## Operations

### Get by sys_id

Retrieve an incident using its unique system identifier.

#### Input

JSON object on stdin:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | Yes | Set to `"get"` |
| `sys_id` | Yes | The sys_id of the incident |
| `fields` | No | Comma-separated list of fields to return |
| `display_value` | No | Display value setting (`true`, `false`, `all`) |

#### Example

```bash
echo '{
  "action": "get",
  "sys_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6"
}' | python scripts/incidents.py
```

Get specific fields only:

```bash
echo '{
  "action": "get",
  "sys_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6",
  "fields": "number,short_description,state,priority"
}' | python scripts/incidents.py
```

### Get by Number

Retrieve an incident using its incident number (e.g., INC0010001).

#### Input

JSON object on stdin:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | Yes | Set to `"get_by_number"` |
| `number` | Yes | The incident number (e.g., "INC0010001") |
| `fields` | No | Comma-separated list of fields to return |
| `display_value` | No | Display value setting (`true`, `false`, `all`) |

#### Example

```bash
echo '{
  "action": "get_by_number",
  "number": "INC0010001"
}' | python scripts/incidents.py
```

Get with display values:

```bash
echo '{
  "action": "get_by_number",
  "number": "INC0010001",
  "display_value": "true"
}' | python scripts/incidents.py
```

## Related Domains

Incidents often intersect with other ServiceNow domains. Consider these related skills for comprehensive incident management:

### Problem Management
Incidents are often linked to problems for root cause analysis:
- **[Get Problem](../problems/get-problem.md)** - Retrieve details of problems that may be the root cause
- **[Query Problems](../problems/query-problems.md)** - Search for known problems related to this incident

> **Tip:** Check if a known error exists for recurring incidents to apply documented workarounds quickly.

### Change Management
Incidents may be caused by changes or may require changes to resolve:
- **[Get Change Request](../changes/get-change.md)** - Retrieve details of change requests that may have caused the incident
- **[Query Change Requests](../changes/query-changes.md)** - Search for recent changes that might be related to the incident

> **Tip:** When troubleshooting incidents, check recent changes in the affected area using the changes skill to identify potential root causes.

### Service Catalog
Incidents may result in service requests or be related to catalog items:
- **[Browse Catalog](../catalog/browse-catalog.md)** - Browse available service catalog items for remediation options
- **[Search Catalog](../catalog/search-catalog.md)** - Search for specific service offerings that may help resolve the incident
- **[Request Status](../catalog/request-status.md)** - Track the status of service requests related to incident resolution

## Errors

The script will output error details to stderr and exit with non-zero status if:

- Required `action` parameter is missing
- Required `sys_id` (for get) or `number` (for get_by_number) is missing
- Incident is not found (returns empty object for get_by_number, NotFoundError for get)
- User lacks permission to view the incident
- API authentication fails
