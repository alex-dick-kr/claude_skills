## Related Domains

Service catalog requests often relate to other ServiceNow domains. Consider these related skills for comprehensive request tracking:

### Incident Management
Track requests related to incident resolution:
- **[Get Incident](../incidents/get-incident.md)** - Retrieve incident details associated with catalog requests
- **[Query Incidents](../incidents/query-incidents.md)** - Find incidents that triggered catalog requests

### Problem Management
Track requests created as part of problem resolution:
- **[Get Problem](../problems/get-problem.md)** - Retrieve problem details associated with catalog requests
- **[Query Problems](../problems/query-problems.md)** - Find problems with pending catalog requests

### Change Management
Track requests that trigger or are associated with changes:
- **[Get Change Request](../changes/get-change.md)** - Retrieve change request details initiated through catalog requests
- **[Query Change Requests](../changes/query-changes.md)** - Find changes associated with catalog requests

> **Tip:** When a catalog request triggers a change, monitor both the request status and the associated change status for complete visibility.

## Errors

The script will output error details to stderr and exit with non-zero status if:

- Required `action` parameter is missing
- Neither `request_number` nor `request_sys_id` provided (for status action)
- Invalid `action` value provided
- Invalid encoded query syntax
- User lacks permission to view requests
- API authentication fails
